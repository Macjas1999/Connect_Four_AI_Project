# Connect Four AI Project
This is a artificial intelligence sandbox to lear basics of how to create and train neural networks. Project is based on a simple idea of creating well known Connect Four game in command prompt with Python. I have chosen Python for this project because it has many convenient tools for creating neural networks. 
Project is still in development and it might seem messy, but it is to be fixed in the future.
